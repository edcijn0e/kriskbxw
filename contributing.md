I would love to integrate unit testing in this project, but unfortunately my knowledge of testing in the JavaScript/Node.js world is very limited. (I'm actually a PHP dev) So this would be a very helpful thing to contribute but of course all contributions are very welcome.

    Please work in your own branch, e.g. integrate-awesome-feature, fix-awful-bug, improve-this-crappy-docs
    Create a pull request to the dev branch
